Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list


//Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
int getNthFromLast(Node *head, int n)
{
       Node* fast = head;
       Node* slow = head;
       
       int cnt=0;

       //move forward fast ptr by n-1 position
       while(cnt <= n-1 && fast != NULL){
           fast = fast->next;
           cnt++;  //no of nodes
       } 
       if( cnt<n){
           return -1;
       }
       //move forward both fast & slow by 1 step
       while( fast != NULL){
           fast = fast->next;
           slow = slow->next;
       }
       return slow->data;
}
