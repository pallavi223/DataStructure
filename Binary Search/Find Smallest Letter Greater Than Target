Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicogrpahically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].


 char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        
      //same as finding ceil of an array == greater letter(ele) which is smaller than target ele
      //Apply binary serach here
      int start = 0;
      int end = letters.size()-1;
    char res = letters[0]; //if no characters present which we are seraching(or no condi true than give arr[0])
      while( start <= end){
          int mid = start+(end-start)/2;
          if(target == letters[mid]){    //if target is in mid move to next right
             start = mid+1;
          } 
          if(target > letters[mid]){    //key is greater move right
              start = mid+1;
          }
          else if(target < letters[mid]){
              res = letters[mid];
              end = mid-1;
          }

      }
      return res;
    }
